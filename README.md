# Facebook Prophet Modelling on Production Data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, **Facebook_Prophet_Modelling_On_Prod_data.ipynb**, which demonstrates the application of Facebook Prophet for forecasting production data in a reservoir context. The notebook showcases how to leverage Prophet's robust time series modeling capabilities to predict production trends and inform operational decision-making.

## Overview

Accurate production forecasting is essential for optimizing reservoir management and reducing operational costs. This project applies Facebook Prophet to historical production data to capture trends, seasonality, and potential external influences. Key aspects include:

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Utilizes Prophet to model historical production data and generate future forecasts.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Involves cleaning, formatting, and preparing production data (e.g., oil, gas, water) for analysis.
- **Model Tuning:** Demonstrates hyperparameter tuning and the inclusion of additional regressors to enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Provides interactive plots to visualize forecasted trends and uncertainty intervals.
